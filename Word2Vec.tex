\title[Text Representations]{Introduction to learning of text representations}

% A subtitle is optional and this may be deleted


\author{Prakhar Gupta}
% - Give the names in the same order as the appear in the paper.
% - Use the \inst{?} command only if the authors have different
%   affiliation.

\institute[EPFL] % (optional, but mostly needed)
{
  
  Department of Computer and Communication Sciences\\
  EPFL
}
% - Use the \inst command only if there are several affiliations.
% - Keep it simple, no one is interested in your street address.

\date[Advanced topics in ML]{Advanced Topics in Machine Learning}
% - Either use conference name or its abbreviation.
% - Not really informative to the audience, more for people (including
%   yourself) who are reading the slides online

% This is only inserted into the PDF information catalog. Can be left
% out. 

% If you have a file called "university-logo-filename.xxx", where xxx
% is a graphic format that can be processed by latex or pdflatex,

% \pgfdeclareimage[height=0.5cm]{university-logo}{university-logo-filename}
% \logo{\pgfuseimage{university-logo}}

\section{Learning of word representations}

\subsection{GloVe}

\begin{frame}{Matrix Factorization Methods}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item<2-> Models that can be described as optimization problems of the form
    \begin{align}
    \min_{U,V} F(UV^T)
    \end{align}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation}
  \begin{block}{Some important definitions and notation}
  \begin{enumerate} 
     \item<2-> Context window is defined as the neighbourhood of a word and its length can be chosen 
     as desired.
     \item<3-> Word co-occurence matrix is denoted by $X$
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item<4-> where $X_{ij} =$ Number of times word $j$ appears in context of word $i$
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation}
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item<2-> The aim is to capture $X_ij$ using the source embeddings $u_i$ and target embeddings $v_j$
   \item<3-> The GloVe problem is thus formulated as 
   \begin{align}
    \min_{U,V} \sum{i,j \in W} f(X_{ij})(u_i^Tv_j + b_i + c_j + log (X_ij))
   \end{align}
    where $f(X_{ij})$ is the weight assigned to the source-target pair, $b_i$ and $c_j$ are the 
    biases associated with $u_i$ and $v_j$ respectively and $W$ is the vocabulary.
    \item<4-> $f(X_{ij})$ is often chosen to be $(\frac{X_{ij}}{Y})^\alpha$ where $Y = \max_{kl}X_{kl}$.
    \item<5-> Empirically $\alpha = \frac{3}{4}$ gives the best performance.

  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{frame}


\subsection{Second Subsection}

% You can reveal the parts of a slide one at a time
% with the \pause command:
\begin{frame}{Second Slide Title}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {
    First item.
    \pause % The slide will pause after showing the first item
  }
  \item {   
    Second item.
  }
  % You can also specify when the content should appear
  % by using <n->:
  \item<3-> {
    Third item.
  }
  \item<4-> {
    Fourth item.
  }
  % or you can use the \uncover command to reveal general
  % content (not just \items):
  \item<5-> {
    Fifth item. \uncover<6->{Extra text in the fifth item.}
  }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Second Main Section}

\subsection{Another Subsection}

\begin{frame}{Blocks}
\begin{block}{Block Title}
You can also highlight sections of your presentation in a block, with it's own title
\end{block}
\begin{theorem}
There are separate environments for theorems, examples, definitions and proofs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}
Here is an example of an example block.
\end{example}
\end{frame}

% Placing a * after \section means it will not show in the
% outline or table of contents.
\section*{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    The \alert{first main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    The \alert{second main message} of your talk in one or two lines.
  \item
    Perhaps a \alert{third message}, but not more than that.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Outlook
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Something you haven't solved.
    \item
      Something else you haven't solved.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
